# smoke-profile-boot.sh — boot the production tui bundle set against a FRESH,
# throwaway DSH_HOME and prove the plugin tree mounts. Zero LLM calls.
#
# Guards two incident classes that both shipped as "merged green, broken for
# every end user" (v0.4.1 tui boot crash, 2026-09-04):
#
#   A. A publishable package whose `lib/` is never emitted (e.g. missing from
#      tsconfig.packages.json) mounts as `Cannot find module .../lib/index.js`.
#      `check:exports` is the cheap static filter; this boot is the proof.
#   B. A runtime import declared as a peer that the host install does NOT carry
#      (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-base`'s npm closure lacks
#      `@deepseek-ai/dsh-web-fetch-http`, and profiles install with
#      `autoInstallPeers: false`) mounts as `Cannot find package ...`.
#      Only a boot with a user-grade resolution pool catches this.
#
# How the pool gets user-grade fidelity: we never pre-create
# $DSH_HOME/profiles/node_modules. The CLI's own prepareProfile() runs
# healProfilesModuleFallback(INSTALL_ANCHOR), materializing the shared
# fallback from the harness CLI's install tree — same composition as the
# published npm `@deepseek-ai/dsh` dependency closure, and therefore exactly
# the pool a real user's plugins resolve against. The @jianxx/* copies come
# from scripts/sync-local-profile.sh (built lib/ + plain-npm runtime
# `dependencies` copied into the profile root node_modules).
#
# Pass criteria (deliberately fail-closed):
#   1. the pty transcript is NON-EMPTY (an empty log proves nothing about
#      boot and would make signature checks vacuous),
#   2. the log contains `dsh cc-mode` — the TUI's first rendered frame, which
#      can only appear after the FULL plugin tree (bundles + cc preset incl.
#      cc-services: serena-first, web-fetch-http-cc) has mounted,
#   3. the log has no loader-failure signatures.
#
# Two runs: a warm-up (loose budget, unasserted) lets the one-time fallback
# heal happen outside the timed window, so a slow cold-cache heal never
# masquerades as a boot regression. Each run polls the transcript once per
# second and kills the boot as soon as the marker is seen — a healthy gate
# finishes in ~10-15 seconds, not at the budget.
#
# The pseudo-TTY comes from python3's pty.spawn (stdlib): `script(1)` exits
# immediately when it has no controlling terminal on macOS and loses its
# transcript file when watchdog-killed — both verified 2026-09-04. pty.spawn
# gives the child its own controlling terminal regardless of how this script
# is invoked (CI step, pipe, hook), on macOS and Linux alike. python3 is
# already a repo tool (test:e2e).
#
# Known fidelity gap (accepted): the layout is workspace copies, not the npm
# tarballs. A `files:` whitelist that forgets lib/ or a tarball-level exports
# mistake is not exercised here — that remains check:exports' job (presubmit +
# publish both run it before this smoke).
#
# The harness CLI is expected pre-built at <repo>/../deepseek-harness/apps/cli
# (override with DSH_HARNESS_DIR); presubmit/publish build or cache it first.
# Local convenience: when the sibling checkout exists but its lib/ is only
# half-built, an npm-global dsh (what end users actually run) is used instead,
# with a note on stderr. CI runners have no global dsh, so a bad harness build
# can never silently reroute there.
# Local: `pnpm smoke:profile-boot`.
