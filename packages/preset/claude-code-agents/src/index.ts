/**
 * Load Claude Code's `.claude/agents` sub-agent definitions as dsh agent

 * project layers, parses and validates every `.md`/`.json` agent file, and
 * returns one {@link AgentDefinition} per agent — ready to be mounted by a
 * preset row or subagent driver.
 *
 * The loader is deliberately integration-free on purpose it is CLI-domain pure:
 * it produces typed definitions and leaves their consumption (scoped tool
 * restriction, request rewriting, permission selection) to the caller, so the
 * model-facing parts can be reused by a Claude Code plugin loader elsewhere
 * without dragging in the harness runtime.
