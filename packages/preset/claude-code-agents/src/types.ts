/**
 * Shared vocabulary for loading Claude Code's `.claude/agents/*.md` and
 * `*.json` sub-agent definitions into the harness. The loader is a pure,
 * filesystem-only translation: it produces one {@link AgentDefinition} per
 * dispatched agent file, computing the effective tool restriction and the
 * system prompt exactly as the source frontmatter declares them, so a later
 * consumer (an agent preset row, a subagent driver) can mount them without
 * re-reading agent semantics.
 *
 * Fields deliberately mirror the Claude Code agent schema so an existing
 * `.claude/agents` tree ports without rewriting. Unknown frontmatter keys are
 * ignored, not forwarded, so a definition authored against a newer Claude
 * Code release degrades to the supported subset rather than failing to load.
