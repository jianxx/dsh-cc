/**
 * Host-side write-back for memory fork output.
 *
 * The extraction/dream forks inherit the parent session's sandbox policy,
 * under which the memory directory (the harness home) is OUTSIDE the session
 * workspace: every model-side `write` is fenced, and a background job cannot
 * escalate (escalation prompts, and its approval policy is `never`). So the
 * forks return their file set as structured output and the plugin — trusted
 * host code — performs the writes itself, stamping a per-call policy whose
 * writable root IS the memory directory. The sandbox still confines each
 * write behind the filename validation below (defense in depth); nothing
 * outside the memory directory becomes writable.
 *
 * Validation rejects the WHOLE batch on any violation — a partial write would
 * leave the index and its topic files inconsistent with no signal back to the
 * fork that produced them.
 * @module @jianxx/dsh-cc-memory-consolidation/writeback
