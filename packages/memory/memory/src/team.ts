/**
 * Team memory: an opt-in shared per-project memory directory layered on the
 * private memdir. Provides the team path resolution, the dual-directory
 * (private + team) merged prompt, and a seam-native read/write path validation
 * chain so a relative key cannot escape the team directory.
 *
 * Security model (three hard prerequisites, all enforced before any read or
 * write):
 * 1. **Key sanitization** — a pure string pass (`sanitizePathKey`) run before
 *    any filesystem operation rejects null bytes, URL-encoded traversal, NFKC
 *    normalization differences, backslashes, and absolute keys.
 * 2. **Seam-native validation chain** — for the sanitized key: `fs.lstat`
 *    rejects a final-segment symlink, then `fs.resolve` + `fs.contains`
 *    enforce prefix containment against the resolved team root.
 * 3. **Containment on every access** — reads and writes go through the chain,
 *    so a symlinked intermediate component that points outside is caught by
 *    the resolve + contains step.
 *
 * Residual gap (documented): this closes per-access traversal, but a
 * mutate-between-check TOCTOU window on *intermediate* components is not fully
 * closed — only the final segment is lstat-checked, and the resolve/contains
 * check and the read are not atomic. Do not enable `teamEnabled` in multi-tenant
 * or untrusted-writer deployments.
