/**
 * Host-side application of an alias-stamped reasoning effort.
 *
 * Named CC subagents carry `reasoningEffort` on their child options as an
 * undeclared runtime extra key (stamped by the Task tool / plugin-loader when
 * the spawn's alias resolved with one). `buildRequest` deep-freezes its seed
 * config and the fork may have restored an explicit parent `/effort` from the
 * seed `request/header` — the alias contract must win — so the host
 * `agent/request` listener in the routes service overlays the stamp AFTER
 * `next()` via this helper.
 *
 * The overlay is a shallow copy: assigning onto the resolved config in place
 * throws on the frozen seed or is invisible. Any absent/blank/non-string
 * stamp is a no-op returning the input unchanged.
