# @jianxx/dsh-cc-output-styles

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Claude Code-compatible output style selection for the DeepSeek Harness. The selected style contributes a system-prompt section through the [`systemPrompt`](../../core/system-prompt/README.md) registry — empty for the `default` style — so the model's communication contract mirrors the familiar Claude Code `Explanatory` / `Learning` styles plus project- and user-authored custom styles.

## Output styles

Three built-in styles ship with the package:

| Style | Effect |
|---|---|
| `default` | Contributes no section. |
| `Explanatory` | Directs the model to explain its implementation choices and codebase patterns as it works. |
| `Learning` | Directs the model to teach collaboratively, requesting short hands-on practice contributions gated by a single `TODO(human)` marker. |

Custom styles are loaded from `<project>/.claude/output-styles/*.md` (project) and the harness home `~/.dsh/output-styles/*.md`, with the later project directory overriding a same-named earlier style. Each file name becomes the style name; frontmatter supplies a `description` (required) and an optional `keep-coding-instructions` boolean (default `true`):

```md
---
description: Keep answers concise and skip the usual preamble.
keep-coding-instructions: false
---
Your concise coding and communication instructions here.
```

When `keep-coding-instructions` is `false`, the contributed section states that it replaces the default coding-instruction section; when `true` (the default), the default coding instructions are retained alongside the style's prose. Malformed or missing frontmatter fails the plugin load loud.

## Selection

The active style is the settings key `outputStyle` in the `cc-output-styles` namespace, layered over the plugin composition `outputStyle` config. Without a settings provider the composition value stands; then `/output-style` still switches in-session.

A switch re-emits `system-prompt/change`, so the next assembled prompt picks up the new style's section.

## `/output-style` command

Registered through [`ctx.commands`](../../interaction/commands/README.md); every composed command adapter discovers it without a model turn.

| Input | Result |
|---|---|
| `/output-style` | Show the current style and the selectable styles. |
| `/output-style <name>` | Set the active style; unknown names return an error listing the selectable styles. |

## Composition

The plugin injects `systemPrompt` and `commands`. Custom apps mount their owners plus this row:

```yaml
- id: system-prompt
  name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-system-prompt'
- id: commands
  name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-commands'
- id: cc-output-styles
  name: '@jianxx/dsh-cc-output-styles'
  config:
    outputStyle: Explanatory
```

## Model Experience

### Output style section

#### What the model sees

While a non-default style is active, its prose appears as the `cc:output-style` prompt section, rendered before the deployment persona. The `default` style contributes nothing.

#### Token effect

The `default` style adds no tokens. Non-default styles add their section prose to each assembled prompt.

#### KV Cache effect

The contribution is a fixed prompt-section provider; a style switch changes the section text and so the assembled prompt for the following turn, like any system-prompt section change.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- **Prompt-section replacement only** — `keep-coding-instructions: false` is expressed in the contributed section's lead-in rather than by unregistering the harness's own coding-instruction provider, which owns that slot.
- **Composition fallback is static** — without a settings provider the selection reverts to the composition `outputStyle` after a reload; `/output-style` persistence needs the `settings` service.
- **No plugin-forced styles** — Claude Code's plugin-authored `force-for-plugin` output styles are out of scope for this row.
