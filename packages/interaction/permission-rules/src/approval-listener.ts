/**
 * WS3 approval-seam listener: auto-approves sandbox escalations in `auto`
 * mode when the operation is attributable to the session workspace.
 *
 * WS0 verified that sandbox escalation prompts travel a separate
 * `approval/request` seam, independent of permission modes — so a mode-based
 * override cannot suppress them. This listener registers on that seam's
 * waterfall (before any UI listener) and resolves the request itself when
 * ALL of the following hold:
 *
 * 1. the request carries a reason identifying it as a sandbox escalation
 *    ({@link isSandboxEscalation});
 * 2. the effective permission mode for the requesting session is `auto`;
 * 3. the session has a resolvable workspace root (the per-call sandbox policy
 *    is derived from the session cwd — WS3 — so a known workspace root is
 *    exactly the boundary the escalation was evaluated against).
 *
 * Otherwise the request falls through to `next()` and the normal approval
 * flow proceeds. Every auto-approval is audit-logged to the session log as a
 * `permission/session-allow` record with `scope: 'sandbox-auto'`.
 *
 * @module @jianxx/dsh-cc-permission-rules/approval-listener
