/**
 * Durable per-session permission-mode override, stored as `permission/mode`
 * session events (last-wins fold). Because plan mode is owned by plan-mode's own
 * `plan/mode` event, `plan` is never written here — it overlays at call time via
 * `foldPlanMode`. Entering `bypassPermissions` also records the prior sandbox
 * mode as `resumeSandbox` so leaving can restore the pre-bypass confinement.
 *
 * Cross-repo event registration: this module adds `permission/mode` to the
 * upstream `KNOWN_SESSION_EVENT_TYPES` set at load so the persistence layer
 * will resume logs containing it on harness builds whose catalog lacks it
 * (persistence refuses unknown types unless the type is registered there). The
 * set is typed `ReadonlySet` but is a live `Set`. Fold/append go through a
 * local wire face rather than `SessionEventMap['permission/mode']` so both
 * the CI pin (type absent) and a newer local harness (narrower `{mode}`
 * shape) typecheck. PermissionModeEventData carries `auto` and
 * `resumeSandbox`, which postdate both of those catalogs.
