Steps:
1. Explore the repository structure: top-level directories, key source files, language, and framework.
2. Identify the exact commands to build and test the project, and how to run them.
3. Note the codebase's conventions: naming, formatting, package layout, and any documented workflow.
4. Write CLAUDE.md with sections covering: project overview, common commands, code style and conventions, and how to verify changes.

If a CLAUDE.md already exists, refresh it in place, preserving what remains accurate and updating what has changed. Do not invent commands — verify them against what the repository actually defines.`
