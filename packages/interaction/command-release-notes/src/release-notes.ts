## 0.1.0-rc.5 — Claude Code feature parity

- **Permissions durability** — the permission-rule engine (allow/deny/ask +
  mode) now reads its rules from a durable settings section, so edits survive
  restarts and hot-reload without a re-deploy.
- **Hook events** — a 27-event CC hook bridge (command + http executors)
  surfaces lifecycle, permission, and tool events to external hook runners.
- **Schedule** — hook and command scheduling runs recurring work through the
  harness's turn-loop seams.
- **WebFetch / WebSearch** — web fetch and search tooling integrates with the
  standard tool registry.
- **Commands** — human-facing slash commands: /status, /doctor, /cost,
  /export, /stats.
- **Memory** — CLAUDE.md-style file memory with dynamic recall by a forked
  side-query, plus background consolidation.
- **Skills** — SKILL.md providers read CC directories; ToolSearch resolves
  deferred tool names.
- **MCP** — a vendored MCP client with OAuth 2.1, resources, and prompts, plus
  a .mcp.json parser.
- **Project shape** — settings-cascade (5-level file precedence), subagent
  coordinator, compaction-micro, and git-worktree tools.

See per-package READMEs for detailed contracts.
