 * Rules:
 * - A name survives only when the registry knows it. Everything else is
 *   dropped with a warning; there is no static legal-names set, so mounted
 *   MCP tools and any future registered row are accepted without code churn.
 * - If the filter carried an `allow` list and any kept allow name is an MCP
 *   tool while `ToolSearch` is itself restrictable, `ToolSearch` is appended
 *   (deduped): the child otherwise holds MCP names with no load path.
 * - If the filter carried an `allow` list and sanitization left nothing, the
 *   result is `{ allow: [] }` — omitting `allow` would WIDEN the child to
 *   every tool, so an emptied allow-list is pinned as deny-all, loudly.
