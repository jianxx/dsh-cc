# @jianxx/dsh-cc-subagent-task

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

The Claude Code-compatible **Task tool** and **per-workspace subagent catalog** for the
DeepSeek Harness. It mounts:

- the `subagent_fork` tool (CC display name `Task`) with `subagent_type` dispatch over the
  session workspace's `.claude/agents` definitions;
- the `Available subagents` system-prompt section, rendered per workspace;
- the reserved tool names (`subagent`, `workflow`) that keep disabled harness rows
  restrictable;
- a pre-step strip listener that removes the harness `agent-instructions` workspace
  baseline (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md) from delegated Task children.

The `ccModelRoutes` service (from `@jianxx/dsh-cc-model-aliases`) supplies the spawn-time
alias resolver; when it is absent, every child inherits its parent's route (the builtin
fallback).

## What it is

Claude Code's `Task` tool lets the main agent delegate to a named subagent
(`subagent_type`, e.g. `deep-reasoner`) defined in `.claude/agents`, and the runner loads
that agent's own system prompt, model, and tool restriction. Historically the DeepSeek
Harness only had a generic fork (`description`/`prompt`), so `subagent_type` dispatch was a
dead letter: the child only ever got the *hand-written role copy* the main model put in the
prompt, and the agent's `model: opus` alias never reached the backend route.

This package restores the real link. It discovers the CC `.claude/agents` definitions that
are visible from the **session's** working directory (not the host process cwd — a web host
serves many workspaces, so `~/.dsh/…` startup must still see `my-repo/.claude/agents`), and
turns the internal `subagent_fork` tool into a genuine subagent-type dispatcher.

## How dispatch works

Given a `Task(subagent_type, description, prompt)` call from a CC preset session:

1. **`subagent_type` omitted, blank, or `general-purpose`** → a **fresh spawn** of the
   caller: the prompt text becomes the child's first user message, no definition
   participates, no parent conversation is copied. Write a self-contained prompt.
2. **`subagent_type` equal to the reserved sentinel `fork`** → a conversation-inheriting
   **fork** of the caller (Claude Code's `subagent_type: "fork"`): completed parent turns
   seed the child; no definition participates. The sentinel is reserved and wins over a
   workspace file of the same name — `.claude/agents/fork.md` is unreachable.
3. **A type that matches a definition** under the session cwd (`cwdOf` the assembling agent)
   → a `spawn` with:
   - `persona` = the definition's `systemPrompt` (delivered as the child's system segment);
   - the task text as the child's **first user message**;
   - `agentOptions` = the alias-resolved `{ provider?, model? }` from
     `ctx.get('ccModelRoutes').resolve(def.model)` (only provider/model fields that resolve
     to a value are forwarded, so per-field inheritance never breaks);
   - `toolFilter` = the definition's `toolRestriction` (allow/deny), **sanitized** of tool
     names this composition no longer registers;
   - `maxDepth` = 3 (matches the harness default; configurable).
4. **Any other type** (not found in the workspace) → an **error result** listing the
   available types in this workspace (or noting the workspace defines none).

The run is **foreground one-shot**: the tool awaits the child to completion and returns its
final text. A non-`completed` stop reason is surfaced as an error, and only `text` blocks of
the child output are concatenated.

### Tool-restriction sanitization and reserved names

When a definition's frontmatter narrows tools (e.g. `tools: Read, Task`), the allow/deny
lists are forced through the CC→harness translation and then checked against the **live**
set of names the tools registry knows (`ctx.tools.view(callingAgent).restrictableNames` —
registered and reserved names, read at execute time against the calling agent's scope so
standing-scope MCP reservations are visible). A name the registry does not know is dropped
with a warning; there is no static legal-names set, so mounted MCP tools and any future
registered row are accepted without code churn:

- **MCP public names.** An exact `mcp__<server>__<tool>` entry is kept as written — it must
  be the tool's public name, including the deterministic 12-hex identity-hash suffix when
  normalization truncated or replaced the name.
- **Server-level MCP wildcards.** `mcp__<server>` and `mcp__<server>__*` both expand to
  every mounted tool of that server (`mcp__<server>__` prefix), so frontmatter survives
  servers publishing new tools without naming hashed entries.
- **A bare `mcp__`** (no server segment) is dropped with an invalid-wildcard warning.
- **Auto-`ToolSearch`.** If the filter carried an `allow` list, any kept allow name is an
  MCP tool, and the `ToolSearch` tool is itself mounted (restrictable), `ToolSearch` is
  appended (deduped) — otherwise the child would hold MCP names with no load path. When
  `ToolSearch` is not mounted it is never injected.
- **Unmounted names are dropped** with the standard `dropping unknown tool name …`
  warning — including MCP names of servers that are not mounted.
- **An allow-list that matches nothing is deny-all, loudly.** If the filter carried an
  `allow` list and sanitization left zero names, the emitted filter is `{ allow: [] }`
  (the child runs with zero tools) with a warning naming the dropped originals — omitting
  `allow` would instead widen the child to every tool. An emptied `deny` list is simply
  omitted.

The internal tool name `subagent_fork` is registered by this package, and
`ctx.tools.reserve('subagent')` / `reserve('workflow')` keep those names in the restrictable
universe without exposing visible definitions (the CC frontmatter `Task` translation is
`['subagent', 'subagent_fork']`, so `subagent` must remain legal even though the harness
spawn row is disabled; `workflow` is reserved for the deferred workflow row). Because
sanitization checks the live registry rather than a static list, these reserved names and
every static CC name (`read`, `bash`, …) survive only when they are actually
reserved/registered — which they are in the cc preset. A definition that omits both
`tools` and `disallowedTools` passes no `toolFilter`, so the child inherits the full
parent tool view (including MCP schemas).

## Available subagents system-prompt section

A single global section (`cc:subagent-catalog`, order 110) serves every agent. Its text
callback receives the assembling agent through the assemble scope, derives that agent's cwd,
and renders:

```
## Available subagents

- deep-reasoner — reason through hard architecture and design problems
- fast-worker — execute a pre-approved mechanical plan

To delegate to one, pass its name as the `subagent_type` argument of the Task tool.
```

Because the section text is composed synchronously but discovery is async, the first
assembly for an unknown workspace shows nothing, then `system-prompt/change` fires once
discovery lands and reassembly reveals the catalog. When a workspace defines no agents (or
there is no agent to scope to) the section renders an empty string and drops out of the
prompt. The catalog lists only file definitions — it deliberately does **not** enumerate seam
backend provider names (`fork`/`spawn`/`codex`/`claude-code`) as if they were addressable
agent types.

## Workspace instructions on Task children

The harness `agent-instructions` plugin injects the workspace CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md
baseline as an `agent-instructions`-sourced user message on every session — including
Task children. This package mounts an `agent/pre-step` listener that strips that baseline
from delegated children (`delegationDepth > 0`):

- A delegated child receives only the enter batch and pending inbox messages that are not
  `agent-instructions`-sourced; its persona remains the agent-file `systemPrompt` (or the
  deployment persona for `general-purpose`).
- Fork children still inherit any CLAUDE.md already in the parent seed — the listener only
  skips a *fresh* child scan; parent history is never rewritten.
- This is an intentional deviation from Claude Code, whose custom subagents **do** load
  CLAUDE.md (Explore/Plan in CC skip it). dsh-cc applies the skip to every Task child
  because the dsh-cc repo CLAUDE.md is orchestrator policy, not a worker contract.
- Residual: the harness still reads the instruction files from disk on the child's behalf;
  they just never enter the child's model-visible batch.

## Mounting

Mounted by the `cc` preset's `tool-task` row (`@jianxx/dsh-cc-subagent-task`) inside the
`cc-services` group, alongside `cc-model-routes` (`@jianxx/dsh-cc-model-aliases`) which
supplies the alias resolver. The cc preset **disables** the harness `tool-subagent` and
`tool-subagent-fork` rows in favour of this tool so there is no double registration of the
`subagent_fork` name.

## Known limits

- **Foreground only.** The harness `tool-subagent-fork` row this tool replaces was
  `backgroundMode: continuable` (durable id + `report`/`send_message` on a host-plane
  singleton). v1 makes the CC Task a foreground one-shot; the durable background/continuable
  workflow is a **follow-up** — this is a visible regression from the previous preset
  behaviour and is tracked honestly in the parity matrix.
- **Process-level discovery cache.** The registry caches per workspace root for the process
  lifetime and does not watch the filesystem. Editing a `.claude/agents` definition takes
  effect on the next session for a workspace whose cache entry has not yet been created, and
  on process restart otherwise. mtime-based invalidation is a follow-up.
- **No plugin-agent dispatch (v1).** Only file definitions under `.claude/agents` are
  dispatched. Seam plugin agents (`AgentProvider`) are not addressed by `subagent_type` in v1
  (their start contract does not carry the task text and their capability flags would reject
  `maxDepth`) — see the parity matrix.
- **Reserved type names.** `general-purpose` and `fork` are sentinels, not file types. A
  workspace file `.claude/agents/fork.md` is unreachable; `subagent_type: "fork"` always
  means inherit completed parent turns.
- **Instruction files are still scanned.** The strip happens after the harness
  `agent-instructions` plugin has read the workspace CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md from disk and
  injected them; this listener only keeps them out of the child's model-visible batch, so
  the disk scan itself cannot be prevented without changing the harness. A fork child's
  parent seed is never rewritten, so CLAUDE.md already in the seed is inherited.

## API

- `apply(ctx)` — cordis plugin entry (plugin id `cc-subagent-task`); safe when either the
  tools or the system-prompt seam is absent.
- `AgentRegistry` (`./registry`) — per-workspace definition cache (`ensure` / `list` /
  `resolve`), lazily loading `loadClaudeCodeAgents(root)` (user layer + project layer,
  project shadows user).
- `registerTaskTool` / `TASK_TOOL` (`./tool`) — register the `subagent_fork` Task tool.
- `mountAgentCatalog` / `CATALOG_SECTION_NAME` / `CATALOG_SECTION_ORDER` (`./catalog`) —
  mount the `Available subagents` section.
- `mountStripWorkspaceInstructions` / `isDelegated` / `isAgentInstructions`
  (`./strip-instructions`) — mount (or classify for) the pre-step strip of the harness
  `agent-instructions` workspace baseline on delegated Task children.

## Non-goals

- `run_in_background` / continuable Task (follow-up).
- Seam plugin-agent dispatch.
- CC frontmatter `permissionMode` / `isolation` / `memory` / `effort` projection onto the
  child (the loader parses them, v1 does not consume them).
- `registerBaseAgents` in cc-shell (base-agent discovery moved here; see the cc-shell README).
