/**
 * Plugin-side concurrency primitives (plan §4.6/§4.7): per-child gate
 * serialization and execution-token-keyed notice delivery.
 *
 * - {@link serializePerKey} runs tasks with the same key strictly in start
 *   order (a per-key promise chain): concurrent gate evaluations +
 *   persistence + followup admission for one cold child cannot interleave.
 *   A failing task propagates its rejection to its own caller only — the
 *   chain continues for later tasks.
 * - {@link ExecutionNoticeBus} keys pending gate notices by the tool
 *   execution identity (`exec.token`, present on both the pre- and
 *   post-execute payloads), so a failing send can never leak its notice into
 *   a later call: only the very same execution may take them.
