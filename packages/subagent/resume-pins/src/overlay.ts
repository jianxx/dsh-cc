 * field's key is REMOVED (assigning `null` is not absence: `prepareCall`
 * would keep filling its adapter default), and a degraded pin touches only
 * explicitly-present fields.
 *
 * Pure: no cordis, no IO. The `agent/request` listener calls this per turn of
 * a pinned child, so options cannot revert to current defaults on any resume
 * path, including ones that bypass the gate.
