/**
 * Durable session cwd events. This module registers the `worktree/entered`
 * session event type into the upstream `KNOWN_SESSION_EVENT_TYPES` set at
 * load (required for persistence-layer compatibility: persistence refuses
 * unknown event types unless the type is registered there). The set is typed
 * `ReadonlySet` but is a live `Set` — same cross-repo registration pattern as
 * `permission/mode` in `@jianxx/dsh-cc-permission-rules`.
 *
 * The event payload is a local wire face (`WorktreeEnteredWire`) rather than
 * `SessionEventMap['worktree/entered']` so both the CI pin (type absent from
 * the typed map) and a newer local harness typecheck: `Session.append` is
 * compiler-validated against the upstream event map, so appends go through a
 * widened function face.
 *
 * @module @jianxx/dsh-cc-session-cwd/events
