/**

 * atomic stroke — so the queue never holds an entry that was already sent and
 * ↑ recall cannot race a flush. Busy is re-asserted optimistically (the
 * flushed followups start a new turn immediately; the fold's `turn/end`
 * handling just set it false), but only when at least one entry was handed
 * off.
 *
 * The stroke is deferred until the agent converges to idle (agent.whenIdle,
 * falling back to one microtask for hosts without it). Two hazards force the
 * wait, both proven by live e2e:
 *
 * 1. The call sites are `session/event` observers running INSIDE the session
 *    append publication window; `followup` → `inbox.splice` appends
 *    `agent/inbox/spliced` synchronously and hits the session reentrancy
 *    guard ("session append cannot reenter while another append is being
 *    published").
 * 2. A bare microtask lands in the driver teardown gap: kick()'s loop already
 *    made its last inbox claim but setPhase(idle) hasn't run, so wakeDriver
 *    takes the non-idle branch — which neither latches the wake (not an
 *    abort/maintenance) nor has a live driver to claim the work. The spliced
 *    message strands in the inbox and the UI sits on a zombie busy anchor.
 *    whenIdle resolves only after kick's finally sets the idle phase, where
 *    wakeDriver's idle path reliably starts the next driver.
