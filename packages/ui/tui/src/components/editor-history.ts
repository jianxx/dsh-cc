/**
 * Reset a pi-tui Editor's ↑/↓ prompt-recall stack from the dsh-cc TUI layer.
 *
 * pi-tui is vendored byte-pure (packages/ui/pi-tui/PORTING.md: re-vendoring
 * replaces `src/` wholesale, so local edits — like a `setHistory` method —
 * would be destroyed and are not allowed). The reset therefore reaches the
 * editor's private slots (`history`, `historyIndex`, `historyDraft`) through
 * a runtime cast instead; `addToHistory` (public) does the refilling so its
 * trim/dedup/cap rules still apply. These field names are stable across the
 * vendored line — re-vendoring to a new upstream SHA must re-check this
 * seam.
