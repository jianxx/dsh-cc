/**
 * Whether a name can be emitted as a bare Python identifier rather than
 * routed to the subscript/`dict[str, Any]` path.
 *
 * Python identifiers are not ASCII: `路径` is as legal a field name as `path`,
 * and rejecting it would degrade the whole enclosing object, dropping every
 * field's name, requiredness, and type — information whose only source under
 * `mode: 'code'` is this generated text.
 *
 * NFKC stability is a second and separate condition, because CPython
 * normalizes identifiers at compile time while JSON keys are compared as
 * written: `ﬁeld` would be declared and reachable as `field`, so the SDK would
 * advertise a key under a spelling the harness never accepts, and two keys
 * that normalize together would collapse into one declaration. Those names
 * take the subscript path, which carries their exact bytes.
 *
 * `IDENTIFIER` matches `str.isidentifier()` (measured on Node 22.23.1 vs
 * CPython 3.9.6 tables): the equivalence holds inside the two versions' shared
 * tables, and the skew characters below are exactly where that pair diverges.
 * The predicate as a whole is deliberately stricter than `isidentifier()`,
 * which does not test NFKC stability: `'ﬁeld'.isidentifier()` is True and
 * this returns false.
 *
 * Both conditions are evaluated against the ENGINE's Unicode tables, and the
 * two sides are versioned independently — `\p{XID_Start}`/`\p{XID_Continue}`
 * follow the running engine (Node 22.23.1 reports Unicode 17.0) while CPython
 * follows its own (3.9.6 reports 13.0.0). The skew is not symmetric. A CPython
 * older than the engine is the dangerous direction: a character added to either
 * property since its tables (U+10570 Vithkuqi and U+1E290 Toto, 14.0; U+1E4D0
 * Nag Mundari, 15.0; U+1C89 Cyrillic TJE, 16.0 — ages per `DerivedAge.txt`; all
 * four are NFKC-stable and accepted here, and all four are `Cn` on that 3.9.6,
 * which rejects them) is emitted bare and its tokenizer refuses the character,
 * taking the whole SDK block down — the same parseability invariant
 * {@link UNPRINTABLE}, {@link LONE_SURROGATE} and {@link MAX_LIST_NESTING}
 * exist for. Both properties carry it: a character added only to `XID_Continue`
 * passes the trailing `\p{XID_Continue}*` in a tail position and fails the same
 * way — U+200C ZWNJ and U+200D ZWJ are that case, gaining `XID_Continue` in UCD
 * 15.1 and absent from it in 13.0.0, 14.0.0 and 15.0.0, so `a\u{200C}b` is
 * emitted bare here while `isidentifier()` is False on 3.9.6 and on 3.12.13
 * (15.0.0). A CPython newer than the engine only routes a legal name to the
 * subscript/`dict[str, Any]` path: less readable, still correct. The NFKC
 * condition reduces to the same skew, since normalization stability guarantees
 * an assigned character's normalization never changes afterwards.
 *
 * This predicate is not the only reader of engine tables. {@link camelCase}
 * reads them at three further points — its split set, its head test, and its
 * `toUpperCase()` case mapping — and this predicate's verdict gates none of
 * them: a class name derived there reaches emitted text whenever any object
 * shape in the tool's schema declares a `TypedDict`, including for a tool this
 * predicate rejected. A tool named `zz-\u{1E4D0}x` with such parameters never
 * reaches the skew here (the `-` rejects it outright) yet emits `class
 * Zz\u{1E4D0}xArgs`, which that same 3.9.6 refuses — Nag Mundari arrived two
 * releases after its tables. The case mapping is a separate table rather than
 * an XID membership test, and it fails on names both conditions above accept:
 * `\u{019B}` is XID_Start and NFKC-stable, so this predicate accepts it and
 * `async def \u{019B}` compiles on 3.9.6, but Node uppercases it to
 * `\u{A7DC}` — unassigned in that CPython, whose own `.upper()` is the identity
 * here — and the declared `class \u{A7DC}Args` fails with `invalid
 * non-printable character U+A7DC`. Closing the exposure therefore covers all
 * four read points, not this predicate alone; it needs the target interpreter's
 * version, which the backend reporting `language: 'python'` owns; the
 * language-dispatch Agent Note records the deferral.
 *
 * The `ts-types` sibling keeps its own ASCII rule rather than sharing this
 * one: ECMAScript identifiers are a different set (`$`) and are never
 * normalized, so one predicate cannot be correct for both. ZWJ/ZWNJ are not
 * part of that difference — both sets carry them on the engine's tables; what
 * separates the two there is the CPython table version above.
 * @param name - the raw schema field or tool name.
 * @returns whether the name can be emitted bare.

 * legal but invisible; escaping them with the same rule keeps the emitted text
 * readable and the treatment uniform.
 *
 * The boundary is the category, not per-code-point addressability: `\xNN`
 * addresses U+0000 to U+00FF, so one escape form covers `Cc` exactly. The

 * would leave a rule that is neither category- nor addressability-shaped. The
 * whole family is legal in both consumers, since only LF and CR terminate a
 * Python string literal or a `#` comment. That set is the tokenizer's, not
 * `str.splitlines()`': NEL (U+0085), LS (U+2028), and PS (U+2029) split a

 * CPython 3.9.6 and 3.12.13, each accepted in both positions with the value
 * round-tripping — so they are safe raw wherever they reach emitted text
 * unescaped, which for all three is `JSON.stringify`, at two call sites:
 * the scalar literal path, and the subscript tool-name comment's own
 * call, which a name carrying any of them always reaches, none being
 * `XID_Continue`. The `description` path escapes NEL under the class above and

/**
 * CamelCase a name into a Python type identifier: non-identifier characters

 * instead of collapsing to the bare prefix. A character that is not
 * `XID_Continue` splits even when it is a letter, so a name whose NFKC folding

 *
 * The result is NFKC-normalized: these names are generated, never matched
 * against a JSON key, so normalizing is free here and keeps what CPython
 * compiles identical to what is emitted — unlike {@link isBareIdentifier},
 * which must reject unstable names outright. Normalizing AFTER the prefix
 * decision is what makes that hold at the seam the prefix creates: `Tool` +

 * normalizing only the un-prefixed part would emit a name CPython compiles to
 * a different symbol. The second call is idempotent on the un-prefixed arm.
