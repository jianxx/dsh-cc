 * Deepest `list[…]` nesting emitted into one annotation before the item type

 * nested parentheses`), so an array chain deeper than that would render an SDK
 * block that is not valid Python at all — the same failure the docstring
 * escaping in the SDK doc renderer exists to prevent. 180 leaves headroom for
 * the few brackets an annotation can add around the chain, all of which count
 * toward the same limit. Per emission site, counting brackets open at the
 * chain's innermost point:
 *
 * - Return annotation, `async def f(self, args: X) -> chain:` — 180 `list[`
 *   plus an innermost `Literal[`. The parameter list's `(` closed at the `)`
 *   before the `->`, so it is NOT open here: 181.
 * - TypedDict field, `field: NotRequired[chain]` — a class-body line with no
 *   other open bracket, and its children start at `listDepth: 1` to reserve
 *   the `NotRequired[`, so 179 `list[` plus `Literal[`: 181. Required fields
 *   share that start for uniformity, spending one level of representable depth
 *   on a bracket they never emit.
 * - Argument annotation, `async def f(self, args: chain) -> Y:` — the `(` IS
 *   still open around it: 180 `list[` plus `Literal[` plus the paren, 182, the
 *   worst case. Reachable only through a raw `register()` whose `parameters`
 *   is an array reached from the root through `oneOf` arms alone — the root
 *   array itself, or one nested under any depth of unions, since an arm
 *   inherits the enclosing depth unchanged (`A | B` opens no bracket). An
 *   object ancestor takes it out of this case: its fields restart the chain at
 *   the 181 site. `defineTool` compiles an object root, so the annotation is a
 *   bare TypedDict class name or a one-bracket `dict[str, Any]` when that
 *   object degrades — never a chain.
 *
 * A CPython grammar limit, not a deployment choice, so it is fixed rather than
 * configurable. The sibling `ts-types` renderer needs no counterpart: nothing
 * in the TypeScript grammar bounds nesting, and its SDK block is never type-
 * checked. Only bracket nesting counts — a `oneOf` renders as a flat `A | B`
 * chain and nested objects render as separate `class` statements, so neither

/**
 * Render one validated scalar as Python literal text (`True`/`False`,

 * type renders directly as `None`, and the unified validator rejects a null
 * `const`/`enum` entry on every other scalar type.
 *
 * A beyond-safe-range integral number takes `BigInt` digits rather than
 * `String`: Python integers are arbitrary-precision, so the emitted digits ARE
 * the value the model programs against, and `String` can give a different
 * integer than the double holds (`2 ** 60` prints the rounded `...847000`, not
 * the exact `...846976`) or no integer literal at all (`1e21` prints `1e+21`).
 * `String`'s rounding is not a bug in it: `Number::toString` emits the shortest
 * decimal string that re-reads to the same double, then pads to the exponent
 * with zeros (1 significant digit for `1e20`, 16 for `2 ** 60`) — and when the
 * shortest string is shorter than the double's exact value, those padded digits
 * name an integer no double holds. Passing one back would have to cross the
 * argument boundary as a JSON number — a double again — so the SDK would
 * document a value no program can pass. `BigInt` needs no case split: where
 * `String` is already exact (`2 ** 53`, `1e20`) the two agree byte for byte,
 * and where it is not, `BigInt` is the exact one. The TS flavor needs no
 * counterpart at all: its literal is re-read by a JS parser back into the same
 * double.
 *
 * `JSON.stringify` is also what keeps this path's output parseable, and it is
 * the only thing that does. It covers both classes of hazard: the two kinds of
 * code point CPython refuses anywhere in source — NUL among the C0 controls,
 * and the whole D800–DFFF unpaired-surrogate block, escaped under ES2019
 * well-formed stringification, which the engines range guarantees — and the
 * ones that break this line in particular, a bare `"` closing the literal
 * early, a trailing odd backslash eating the closing quote, and a bare LF/CR
 * ending it before its terminator. The `description` path carries
 * the unprintable-character and lone-surrogate rules because nothing quotes it,
 * and folds newlines in {@link describe}.
 *
 * That leans on a coincidence worth naming: every escape `JSON.stringify` can
 * emit (`\"`, `\\`, `\b`, `\f`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, `\uXXXX`) is also a Python
 * escape denoting the same character, so the emitted `Literal[...]` both
 * parses and decodes back to the value the schema declared. DEL, the C1
 * controls (NEL among them), and LS/PS (U+2028/U+2029) do reach it raw —
 * legal but invisible, byte-for-byte as in the TS flavor; escaping them is a
 * both-flavors change. Those last three are legal here for the reason
 * the unprintable rule records: they are `str.splitlines()` boundaries, not
 * tokenizer line terminators. The subscript tool-name comment quotes its name
 * through its own call to the same `JSON.stringify`, never through this
 * function, and inherits both halves — escapes and pass-throughs alike.
