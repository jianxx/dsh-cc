# dsh-tool-search

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Deferred tool registration plus a model-facing **ToolSearch** tool that loads heavy tools on demand. A tool that is expensive to load or token-heavy in the prompt can be registered **deferred**: it contributes a name, description, and search hint to a searchable registry, but its real definition stays **out of the model-visible schema and prompt** until the model asks for it.

## Why defer tools

Every visible tool schema costs prompt tokens and, for a heavy capability, load time. Most sessions need only a handful of tools from a large catalog. Deferral carries the *capability metadata* cheaply and loads the material definition only when the model actually summons it — generalizing the `shouldDefer`/ToolSearch mechanism (and the MCP `_meta['anthropic/alwaysLoad']` escape hatch) into the harness's effect-based registry model.

## What it does

[`DeferredToolRegistry`](src/index.ts) is the `ctx.toolSearch` service. A plugin registers a capability deferred:

```ts
ctx.toolSearch.registerDeferred({
  name: 'big_fs_tool',
  description: 'Heavy filesystem capability invoked once per session.',
  searchHint: 'read write edit files',
  alwaysLoad: false,
  activate: () => ctx.tools.register(bigFsToolDefinition), // returns the exact disposer
})
```

The **ToolSearch** model tool then ranks the deferred set against a `query` (`max_results`, default 5) using weighted substring/token matching over name, `searchHint`, and description. On a hit it calls the registration's `activate()` callback — a real `ctx.tools.register()` — so the tool becomes visible to the **next** assembly and then callable exactly like any top-of-prompt tool. `alwaysLoad: true` registers immediately at defer time and is never a deferred candidate.

The design rides the repo's effect conventions:

- **Deferred registration is an effect.** The returned disposer reclaims the deferred entry *and* any activated `ctx.tools` registration together, so a plugin unloading mid-session tears down both.
- **Activation is idempotent.** Re-activating an already-loaded tool is a no-op; re-registration (which would throw on a duplicate name) never happens.
- **Restriction stays authoritative.** `registerDeferred` reserves the tool's name in the `dsh-tools` registry (known but not visible), so a scoped `restrict()` can deny it *before* it loads. ToolSearch checks that gate: a deferred tool a scope denies is **not** activated for that scope, and the result says why.
- **Search is scope-visible.** A deferred registration lands in the calling scope's layer, and ToolSearch searches the *calling agent's* scope chain (itself and ancestors) — so a tool an agent deferred is visible to that agent's search and its descendants, but a sibling scope or the global view never sees it. A globally-deferred tool remains globally visible as before.
- **Deferred names never leak into the prompt.** Only activated (`alwaysLoad` or loaded) tools enter the schema; reserved-but-unloaded names are known for restriction/`toolOrder` purposes but never model-visible.
- **ToolSearch itself is lazy, with hysteresis.** While the searchable pool is empty, only the `ToolSearch` *name* is reserved (restrictable, not visible); the first non-`alwaysLoad` deferred registration brings the tool into the model-visible set, and it then stays registered for the rest of the session even if the pool empties again — a mid-session removal would shift the assembled tool order and break the cached prefix. An empty pool also makes the tool's "tools are hidden, search to load them" description actively misleading, which is why it is withheld.

## Model Experience

Turn one, the model sees only `ToolSearch` plus whatever is already loaded (including `alwaysLoad` tools) — or, in a session with no deferred tools at all, no `ToolSearch` either. It searches for a capability by keywords, and the result names the now-available tools. On the next turn those tools are first-class: declare them, call them. Already-loaded tools drop out of the deferred set, so a second search for them is correctly empty.

An empty search result always says *why*, so the model never mistakes "nothing deferred" for "I lack the capability": an empty pool yields "every tool you can use is already in your function list; call it directly", a fully-loaded pool yields "all deferred tools available to you are already loaded", and a simple miss on a non-empty pool appends "the capability may already be available — call it directly".

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- **Matching is lexical, not semantic.** Ranking uses weighted substring/token scoring; there is no embedding/vector search. This keeps the seam dependency-free and deterministic, at the cost of synonyms that share no token.
- **Global activation.** Loading happens on the host plane (global registration); a per-agent scope sees a loaded tool only if its restriction admits it. There is no per-conversation discovery history — loading is an in-memory effect, so a re-registered composition starts from the deferred pool again.
